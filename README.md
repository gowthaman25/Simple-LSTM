# Simple-LSTM
Here Simple LSTM and bidirectional LSTM model is created for a dataset to compare performance.

Here breast cancer dataset is taken from sklearn library which is classified using lstm model and using bidirectional model to compare both performance. MSE is calculated to get the error rate of the model.
